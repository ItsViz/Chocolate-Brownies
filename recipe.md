Preperation-
1)Preheat the oven to 350 deg F (180 deg C). Line an 8-inch square baking dish with parchment.
2)Chop the chocolate into chunks. Melt half of the chocolate in the microwave in 20-second intervals, saving the other half for later.
3)In a large bowl mix the butter, melted chocolate and the sugar with an electric hand mixer. Once the mixture is cool, beat in the eggs and vanilla until the mixture becomes fluffy.
4)Sift in the flour, cocoa powder and salt. Be careful not to overmix as this will cause the brownies to be more cake-like in texture.
5)Fold in the remaining chocolate chunks and transfer the batter into the prepared baking dish.
6)Bake for 20-25 minutes, depending on how fudgy you like your brownies to be. Let it cool completely.
7)Slice them into 9 square servings and enjoy.
